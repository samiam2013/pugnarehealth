Project to help people get the medical supplies and medicine

Goal is for this to be fork-able so that it can be kept current by community, if it's a helpful resource for enough poeple to gather the help. The hope is that monitoring might be put in place for the most frequently beneficial programs so they can quickly be updated if something changes. 

My original driving motivation is the difficulty I've had getting the particular CGM I want and paying for it. Insurance wants me to get worse before they cover it. I want to get better.

Potential goals for aggregation:
- free trial sensor coupons for CGMs
- savings coupons for CGMs
- free blood glucose / keto monitors
- free/reduced cost test strips
- savings for medicines of all classes
  - (e.g. GLP-1 class is expensive, many copays too)
  - rare non-covered meds (glucagon pen) have savings programs too
- free examination/reduced cost care
- savings card programs like GoodRX
- comparisons of nationwide-chain pharmacy costs
  - CVS, Walgreens, WMT, Sam's, Costco
