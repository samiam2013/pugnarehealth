Project to help people get the available savings on medical supplies and 
medicine needed for diseases on the metabolic health spectrum like diabetes, 
oesity, ASCVD (athero-sclerotic cardio-vascular disease), etc.

It's structured as a bunch of JSON data and a github action that re-deploys
the page daily after checking the FDA labels don't have updates (marking them as
outdated on the  page if they do) via API. The hope is that with good enough 
validation anyone can request a change and as long as it passes CI I could basically
approve it in without worry.

May your health be improved and your savings many! 🤞
