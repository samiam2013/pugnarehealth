Project to help people get the medical supplies and medicine

Goal is for this to be helpful to those who need these very expensive medicines,
as I have become one of them. This is nothing special, just a centralizing resource
to save people time researching or comparing price-savings among options.

It's structured as a bunch of JSON data and a github action that re-deploys
the page daily after checking the FDA labels don't have updates (marking them as
outdated on the  page if they do) via API. The hope is that with good enough 
validation anyone can request a change and as long as it passes CI I could basically
approve it in without worry.

May your health be improved and your savings many! 🤞
